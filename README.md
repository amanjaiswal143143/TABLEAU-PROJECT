Tableau Project: Data Analysis & Visualization Portfolio üìä
Welcome to my portfolio of Tableau Data Analysis Projects! This repository is a showcase of my skills in the end-to-end data analysis lifecycle‚Äîfrom raw data to actionable insights. My goal is to demonstrate my ability to use a variety of tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively.
Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow data professional, or just curious about data, you'll find projects here that highlight my proficiency in multiple areas. Feel free to explore and see how I transform data into a compelling story.
üí° Key Features of My Work
 * Interactive Dashboards: My projects go beyond simple charts. I focus on creating interactive, user-friendly dashboards in Tableau that allow for deep dives into the data and help stakeholders make informed decisions.
 * Data Storytelling: Each project is a narrative. I don't just present numbers; I explain what the data means, uncover key trends, and present my findings in a clear and compelling way.
 * Comprehensive Tool Kit: This repository isn't just a Tableau showcase. It's a testament to my proficiency with the entire data analysis stack, including SQL for data cleaning, Python for advanced analysis, and Excel for foundational reporting.
 * Structured Approach: The projects are organized to reflect a real-world workflow. You can see the initial data preparation in SQL and Python before the final visualization is created in Tableau.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used
 * Tableau: The core tool for dynamic data visualization and dashboard creation.
 * SQL: Used for all data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation. The scripts are included to show my data handling process.
 * Python (Jupyter Notebook): Applied for exploratory data analysis, data manipulation, and building the initial insights before visualization.
 * Microsoft Excel: Utilized for specific tasks like creating pivot tables and organizing data in a structured format.
 * Hadoop: A project demonstrating my experience with big data environments and distributed computing concepts.
üöÄ How to Explore
 * Clone the Repository: Get a local copy of all the project files.
 * View the Dashboards: Open the .twbx files in Tableau Desktop to interact with the visualizations.
 * Inspect the Code: The SQL scripts and Python notebooks are well-commented, so you can follow my logic for data cleaning and analysis.
 * See the Process: Start with the data files, look at the SQL and Python scripts, and then see the final result in the Tableau dashboards to understand my full workflow.
Thank you for your interest in my projects! I hope this portfolio gives you a clear understanding of my skills and passion for data analysis.
